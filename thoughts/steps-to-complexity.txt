    1. Mix HTML and PHP                                     (as simple as it gets)
    2. Put functionality in functions                       (re-usability)
    3. Put functions in separate files                      (maintainability)

    4. Use classes to keep code that looks alike together   (modularity)
    5. Use namespaces to create package-style containers    (seperation of concerns)

    6. Use objects and accompanying mechanisms to keep things manageable (causes complexity!)
    7. Use class hierarchy for variations                   (causing inheritance over composition)

There are no rules, merely guidelines.
Also, there will always be exceptions to rules, so rules are per definition meant to be broken.

There is only one rule: DOES IT WORK? DOES IT FIX THE PROBLEM?

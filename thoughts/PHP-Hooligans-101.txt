# PHP Intro
    It is awesome because:
        - There is no design (We are borg)
        - Backwards compatible
        - API inconsistencies (cross language consistent/use an IDE like an adult)
        
# Pick your fight / Throwing stones
    We will confront you on any of the following subjects until our time to speak runs out:        
        - Design Patterns (the devil loves them!/design patterns are a code smell)
        - Strict typing is not animal friendly! All types should be duck (type hints === tight coupling)
        - Everything is string! (your input is a string, your output is a string, aren't you lucky everything inbetween is too?)
        - Avoid objects (see previous rant) and - Arrays are your friend! (objects are shared state == tight coupling)
        - OOP (You're doing it wrong)
            - Composition OVER Inheritance (duh!)
        - PHP is the only true Framework. All others are solving a problem you don't have. Components MothaFucka!
            - Frameworks are no substitute for architucture
        - URL routing is usually just another form of tight coupling (your Code API is now a Public Web API. Good luck with that one).
        - Write more Tests, write less Code

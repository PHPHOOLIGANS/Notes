Paraphrasing:

In 2011 Object-oriented programming was eliminated entirely from the
introductory curriculum at Carnegie-Mellon as it is unsuitable for a
modern CS curriculum.

Carnegie-Mellon University Professor Robert Harper in March 2011
wrote: "This semester Dan Licata and I are co-teaching a new course on
functional programming for first-year prospective CS majors...
Object-oriented programming is eliminated entirely from the
introductory curriculum, because it is both anti-modular and
anti-parallel by its very nature, and hence unsuitable for a modern CS
curriculum. A proposed new course on object-oriented design
methodology will be offered at the sophomore level for those students
who wish to study this topic."

So, OOP is dead. Just give it some time. OOD might make it but OOP will not.
